# BTEMS
=====
This is the repository for the BTEMS Sensor Stations. Arduino code is in the ```BTEMS``` folder, while the eagle files for the PCB is in the ```BTEMS PCB``` folder. More info to come...

### PCB TODO
1. Build, test, update to 1.1

### General TODO
1. Update BOM
2. Find battery holder
3. Add correct voltage divider resistor to account for batteries

### Code TODO
1. See code comments
2. Make LED blink shorter
3. Put MLX to sleep. Send sleep command via I2C and make power off of digital pin. POR to wake up

### Version 1.1 Todo
4. Move via near RTC header bottom ground pin
5. Move resistors away from LEDs
6. Move arduino external headers away from arduino?
7. Switch to larger screw terminal?
8. Switch vertical direction of arduino headers (tall side up)?
9. Add male headers to sensor plugs
10. Want jumper wires for final product
11. Want MLX switching for final product?
