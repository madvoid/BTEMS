# BTEMS
=====
This is the repository for the BTEMS Sensor Stations. Arduino code is in the ```BTEMS``` folder, while the eagle files for the PCB is in the ```BTEMS PCB``` folder. More info to come...

### PCB TODO
1. Build, test, update to 1.1

### General TODO
1. Update BOM
3. Add correct voltage divider resistor to account for batteries

### Code TODO
1. See code comments

### Version 1.1 Todo
4. Move via near RTC header bottom ground pin
5. Move resistors away from LEDs
6. Move arduino external headers away from arduino?
7. Switch to larger screw terminal?
8. Switch vertical direction of arduino headers (tall side up)?
9. Add male headers to sensor plugs
10. Want jumper wires for final product
11. Want MLX switching for final product?
12. Standard size resistors for LEDs
13. Buy better edge cutters
14. Move 'Environmental Fluid Dynamics Lab' text up (away from switch) a little bit
15. Move 'Off' text down a little bit
16. Decide on 3- or 4-battery holder
17. Move '+/-' text for battery input terminal to more visible location
18. Center RTC against SD card slot?
