# BTEMS
=====
This is the repository for the BTEMS Sensor Stations. Arduino code is in the ```BTEMS``` folder, while the eagle files for the PCB is in the ```BTEMS PCB``` folder. More info to come...

### PCB TODO
1. Build, test, update to 1.1

### General TODO
1. Update BOM
3. Add correct voltage divider resistor to account for batteries

### Code TODO
1. See code comments

### Version 1.1 Todo
4. Move via near RTC header bottom ground pin - Done
5. Move resistors away from LEDs - Done
6. Move arduino external headers away from arduino? - Done
7. Switch to larger screw terminal - Done
8. Switch vertical direction of arduino headers (tall side up)? - N/A to PCB design
9. Add male headers to sensor plugs - N/A to PCB design
10. Want jumper wires for final product - N/A to PCB design
11. Want MLX switching for final product? - Not for v1.1
12. Standard size resistors for LEDs - N/A to PCB design
13. Buy better edge cutters - N/A to PCB design
14. Move 'Environmental Fluid Dynamics Lab' text up (away from switch) a little bit - Done
15. Move 'Off' text down a little bit - No longer applicable
16. Decide on 3- or 4-battery holder - 4-battery chosen
17. Move '+/-' text for battery input terminal to more visible location - Done
18. Center RTC against SD card slot? - Not for v1.1. Too much of writing space would be eliminated. Need to live with off-center :(
19. Add correct resistor values to battery voltage divider - Done

### To Buy
1. Screw terminals
2. Batteries
3. RTC batteries
4. RTCs
5. Jumper wires
6. Standard size LED resistors
7. Standard size battery measurement resistors
8. Battery holders
9. SD Cards?
